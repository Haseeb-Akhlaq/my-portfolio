    subtitle: Hi ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Haseeb, currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science and AI at Edge Hill University, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I'm deeply immersed in the world of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on creating AI chatbots designed to automate and streamline business processes. Alongside this, Iâ€™m actively involved in making projects with Langchain, exploring Vector DB, and experimenting with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT's. My background as a Full Stack Developer, with over two years of experience in Ruby on Rails, React, Flutter, and AWS, provides a solid foundation for my AI endeavors. Iâ€™m also passionate about sharing what I learn, writing easy-to-understand articles on Medium and creating helpful videos on YouTube to explain AI concepts and their real-world applications.
